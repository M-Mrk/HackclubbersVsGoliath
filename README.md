Everyone will have to stick together for this one, as there are many (however many u configure) Monsters on the loose and you can only make a strong attack once every day.
So everyone will have to attack, so that peace can be restored. You can always keep contributing with ur weak attack, but it takes some energy to wind up.

Inspired by the story of David vs Goliath (Note that I have not actually read it but just know the gist)
